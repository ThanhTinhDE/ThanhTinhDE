## Hi there 👋, I'm Thanh Tinh (ThanhTinhSHR/OLD_SILVER).
### 💫 About Me

- I'm actively building my career path toward becoming a Senior Data Engineer by following a structured learning roadmap and working on real-world projects.
- I’m passionate about how data flows through systems, how automated components integrate, and how everything comes together in a **Modern Data Platform**.  
- I prefer going deep into core problems rather than quick fixes.  
- To enhance my ability to design scalable solutions, I'm also learning DevOps alongside data engineering.
- ✉️ You can shoot me an email at thanhtinh.de@gmail.com! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
